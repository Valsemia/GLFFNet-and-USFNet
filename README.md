The source can be found in the references of the article.
## Datasets
We used the SBU, ISTD, and UCF datasets in the paper, and the sources of the datasets are cited in the references. Dataset sharing links can be provided here, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C4e8G8RlR8QVGXj5-wi8RWB7mx8nwu29?usp=drive_link
## Metrics
The evaluation metric for the shadow detection part is BER, which has been uploaded in the file above.

The evaluation metrics for the shadow removal part include: RMSE, SSIM, and PSNR. We used Matlab code, the link is as follows: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qC0SauTBo-GJcHR2guz5CqqHu803UoF?usp=drive_link
